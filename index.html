        <h1>About Derek S. Prijatelj</h1>

        <p>
            Hello there and welcome!
        </p>
        <p>
            I am a researcher of information theory and machine learning, which means I study the theory and application of computation and statistics.
            I am a holistic researcher interested in understanding and modeling complex systems, especially artificial intelligent agents that will encounter uncertainty and novelty in their environment and must learn or adapt to maintain task performance.
        </p>

            I recieved my Ph.D. at the University of Notre Dame with <a href="https://www.wjscheirer.com/">Dr. Walter J. Scheirer</a> as my advisor.
            My dissertation was on "Uncertainty and Novelty in Machine Learning" where I explored both the applications and the theory of how uncertainty and novelty may be encountered and learned by machines.
        </p>

            This year of 2025, I will update this website and add a blog related to my work and interests.
            For now, it serves as hub of my linked internet presence.
